  <h1>Let's start with HTML!</h1>
  <p>First, open the page <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a>, The good thing about using Replit is that you have a free web hosting and you do not need to download absolutely nothing.</p>
  <p>Second, you create a new repl of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
  <p>Now, you open the file index.html, and you change the title of the page, the default title is "Document", and if you changed the title, just click in Run, you have a preview of the page at the right and you can open the page in a new tab.</p>
  <p>Now, you in the tag "body", you put "&lt;p&gt;Testooo&lt;/p&gt;", and if you open the page, the text "Testooo" is on the screen, you can put "h1" instead of "p" so that the text looks bigger and in bold.</p><p class="protip">PRO TIP: just use h1 once per page.</p>
  <p>You can view the types of "h" <a href="typesofh.html">here</a></p>
